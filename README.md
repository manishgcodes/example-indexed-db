## Introduction

This project provides a clear example of how to use IndexedDB in a React application. It includes a custom hook `useIndexedDB` for performing CRUD operations on IndexedDB and an example `App` component demonstrating its usage. IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This example can help developers integrate IndexedDB into their upcoming or existing frontend projects.

## Features

- **Custom Hook**: A reusable custom hook for managing IndexedDB operations.
- **CRUD Operations**: Examples of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects.
- **Optimized Setup**: Created with Vite for a fast and optimized development experience.
- **TypeScript Support**: Includes TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
